CppZip
======

CppZip is an open source c++ zip library and is based on minizip and zlib. CppZip is implemented with
standard C++ (C++11) and some functions of the boost libraries.

It's implementation focus is
 - on easy to use - a clear and well documented API,
 - to run on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, ...),
 - and well tested.


### Build status:

 - [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flo2k/CppZip.svg?branch=test_dll)](https://travis-ci.org/flo2k/CppZip) TravisCI (linux)

 - [![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/qlctko1hvennty1h?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/flo2k/cppzip) AppVeyor (Windows)

### There are two classes in the library:

_Zip_ compresses and zips files and folders.
 - Adding files from memory
 - Adding files from file system
 - Adding complete (and recursive) folders from file system
 - Delete files
 - Replace files
 - Supports Passwords

_Unzip_ uncompresses and unzips zip files.
 - Inspect files inside a zip (e.g. file list)
 - Extract to file system
