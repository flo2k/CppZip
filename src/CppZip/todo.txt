- Document:
	- Zip::open() and the OpenFlags
	- More exampels in the documentation, like a tutorial.
	
	
- Implement:
	- Zip::delete()
	- Zip::fastDelete() with not creating a new zip file (maybe is a little bit tricky and needs
	                                                      deeper knowledge of the zip specification.
	                                                      Maybe, this needs also an shrink method.)
	- Zip::repalce()
    - Signale implementieren + testen
 
    -> Set timestamps correct.
    -> Zip files with passwords.
