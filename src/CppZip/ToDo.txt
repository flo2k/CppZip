- Document:
	- More examples in the documentation, like a tutorial.
	
- Implement:
	- Zip::fastDelete() with not creating a new zip file (maybe is a little bit tricky and needs
	                                                      deeper knowledge of the zip specification.
	                                                      Maybe, this needs also an shrink method.)
    - Signals implement + test
    - Set timestamps correct.
    - Zip files with passwords.
    
- Bug:
	- Zip files with umlauts (ä, ö, ü, ..): (Help: result42.com /projects/ZipFileLayout, ...)
    
- Building:
	- cmake
	- VisualStudio 2010 Solutions
	- Continuous Integration + Delivery
	- linux packages: .deb, .rpm
	- windows libs: shared (dll) + static (lib)
