- Document:
    - Document, that CppZip is not good with handling large files (at the moment).
	- More examples in the documentation, like a tutorial.
	- Create license file
	- Document license on the github description and in the doxygen doc. 
	
- Implement:
	- Zip::fastDelete() with not creating a new zip file (maybe is a little bit tricky and needs
	                                                      deeper knowledge of the zip specification.
	                                                      Maybe, this needs also an shrink method.)
    - Signals implement + test
    - Set timestamps correct.
    - Zip files with passwords.
    - Correct file attributes on unzipping.
    - addFolder() with preserve path!!
    - Filters: for extensions, file names, directories, ... 
      (example1: files that match the filters are added)
      (example2: files that doesn't match the filters are added)
    
- Improve Performance (CppZip is very slow with big files and needs a lot of memory):
    - Measure the time of each function -> maybe, use CppUnit for this
    - Speedup the implementation
    - Reduce the needed memory
    
- Bug:
	- Zip files with umlauts (ä, ö, ü, ..): (Help: result42.com /projects/ZipFileLayout, ...)
    
- Building:
	- cmake
	- VisualStudio 2010 Solutions
	- Continuous Integration + Delivery
	- linux packages: .deb, .rpm
	- windows libs: shared (dll) + static (lib)
